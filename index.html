<h2>WEB</h2><p>
The World Wide Web (WWW, W3) is a global information space where people can share information through computers connected to the Internet. It is often called the Web. This term is often used synonymously with the Internet, but it is strictly a different concept. The Web is just a service running on the Internet, like e-mail. Since 1993, however, the web has taken the absolute position of the Internet structure.
